      description: "Add Account API creates a new Certificate of Deposit Account (CDA) and Retirement Account (IRA).<br>For Signature, while creating an account this API can add up to five secondary or seasonal address records.<br>This API supports a standardized address format for parsed addresses. While using the standardized format, the Postal address aggregate is consolidated into two address line fields that are Address line 1 and Address line 2, instead of segregating into multiple independent fields such as House number, Street, Apartment number and Apartment number type.<br>This API can also set up user-defined fields (ClientDefinedData) when creating a new account. Signature supports 64 fields out of which 60 are user-defined fields, two are user fields and two are user codes. <br> <br> To download the API Specifications and Postman Collection, click <a href=\"../docs/?path=docs/resources/resources.md\" title=\"Click to open\">Resources</a>."
