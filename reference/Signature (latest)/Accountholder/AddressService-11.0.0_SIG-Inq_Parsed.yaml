      summary: Get Address
      description: "Get Address API retrieves the information of secondary/seasonal address records for an account or party using a parsed address format. <br>For Signature, only one secondary or seasonal address is associated with card or Safe Deposit Box (SDB) accounts. The address use field identifies the various types of secondary and seasonal addresses for loan and deposit account types.<br>This API supports a standardized address format for parsed addresses. While using the standardized format, the Postal address aggregate is consolidated into two address line fields that are Address line 1 and Address line 2, instead of segregating into multiple independent fields such as House number, Street, Apartment number and Apartment number type. <br> <br> To download the API Specifications and Postman Collection, click <a href=\"../docs/?path=docs/resources/resources.md\" title=\"Click to open\">Resources</a>."
