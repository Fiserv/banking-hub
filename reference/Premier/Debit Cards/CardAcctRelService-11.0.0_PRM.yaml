            Relationship information of a card linked with accounts.

            **Note:** This aggregate contains key details of the card to which the accounts are linked. Multiple accounts can be linked to the card via CardAcctRelMod ESF operation.

            Existing accounts that are linked to the card should be sent in the request to preserve the association. If an account was already linked to the card, but if not provided in the request will result in de-linking or detachment from the card. The request should contain the final state of card-account relations which is required by consumer so that existing relations can be replaced/overwritten by the operation based on the request sent.

            All accounts that are already linked to the card already can be retrieved via CardAcctRelInq operation. By Default, a maximum of 10 accounts can be linked to the card in Premier (all supported account types included). The number of accounts to be linked can be configured in Card Specifications file in Premier.

            ESF Operation CardAcctRelInq, along with card-account details also returns the Other Account Relationship (OtherAcctRel) field, that provides the primary account for the card (value of 1) and the other secondary accounts (values greater than 1). Using this aggregate the "NickName" on the account linked to the card can also be modified.
