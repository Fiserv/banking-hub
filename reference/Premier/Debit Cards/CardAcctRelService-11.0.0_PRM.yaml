            Relationship information of a card linked with accounts.



            **Note:**This aggregate contains key details of the card to which the accounts link. The Update Card Account Relationship operation allows multiple accounts to link to the card.



            Include existing accounts linked to the card in the request to preserve the association. Omitting an account that is already linked results in its de-linking or detachment from the card. The request should reflect the final state of card-account relations, ensuring that existing relations are replaced or overwritten based on the request.



            Use the Get Card Account Relationship operation to retrieve all accounts already linked to the card. By default, Premier allows a maximum of 10 accounts to link to the card (including all supported account types). Configure the number of accounts to link in the Card Specifications file in Premier.



            The Get Card Account Relationship operation returns card-account details and the Other Account Relationship (OtherAcctRel) field, which identifies the primary account for the card (value of 1) and other secondary accounts (values greater than 1). This aggregate also allows modification of the "NickName" on the account linked to the card.
