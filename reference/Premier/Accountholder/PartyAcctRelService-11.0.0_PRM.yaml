            **Note:** Each account can have only one name. If the value of this field is "true" for multiple names, then only the first name is considered as the Tax Reporting Owner. If no party has the value as "true", then the first party is selected as the tax owner indicator.



            Premier requires this field to be present at all times.



            The tax reporting party can only be an Owner or a Signer.

        **Note:** The "PartyAcctRelInfo" field can be sent multiple times in the request, where each filed describes one customer at a time.

        This API expects the request to include the end status of the customer relationships to the account. If a relationship is not there, then ESF assumes that relationship is no longer required and removes it from the account.
