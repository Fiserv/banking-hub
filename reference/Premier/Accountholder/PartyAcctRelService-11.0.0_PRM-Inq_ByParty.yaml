In this API, the information on closed accounts can be excluded or included. <br> Pagination does not support returning Portfolio or Line accounts in the response. Also, when the accounts with DDL account type are associated with a party, the PartyAcctRelInq service may provide more records (up-to twice) than the number requested, while paginating through DDA and DDL accounts.
