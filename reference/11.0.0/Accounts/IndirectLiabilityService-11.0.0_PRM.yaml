Only one occurrence for this aggregate can be sent along with the PartyId which needs to be associated to the IndirectLiability record being created on the loan (see LiabilityType applicable for the PartyId). If both aggregates are sent then ESF would ignore IndirectLiabilityInfo/PartyKeys and only process occurence(s) of IndirectLiabilityInfo/IndirectLiabilityParty/PartyKeys. Multiple addendas (IndirectLiability Records) can be created with same customer (PartyId) if, other fields are validated successfully. Application should provide the correct PartyId to call this service.
