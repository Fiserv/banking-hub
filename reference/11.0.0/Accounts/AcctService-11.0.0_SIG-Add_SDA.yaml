      description: "Add Account API creates a new Savings Deposit Account (SDA).<br>For Signature, while creating an account this API can add up to five secondary or seasonal address records. <br>This API supports a standardized address format for parsed addresses. While using the standardized format, the Postal address aggregate is consolidated into two address line fields that are Address line 1 and Address line 2, instead of segregating into multiple independent fields such as House number, Street, Apartment number and Apartment number type.<br>This API can also set up user-defined fields (ClientDefinedData) when creating a new account. Signature supports 64 fields out of which 60 are user-defined fields, two are user fields and two are user codes. <br> <br> To download the API Specifications and Postman Collection, click <a href=\"../docs/?path=docs/resources/resources.md\" title=\"Click to open\">Resources</a>."

        **Note:** Default values for fields can be obtained from ESF ProdSpecInq. The calling application can change the default value returned at the product-level, by passing another appropriate allowed value for the field, if need be. In case the default value is not returned by ESF ProdSpecInq for an optional field, then the consumer is not required to pass an explicit value. However, for a field required by the ESF operation, if the default value from ProdSpecInq is not available - then the calling application must explicitly send an appropriate value for it, as per requirement and the allowed value(s) specified.



        Product default values for the following fields can be obtained from the ESF ProdSpecInq service response: 'AcctIdentValue, 'ProductIdent', 'AcctUse', 'BrokeredDeposit',  'ChildSupportTrust', 'CorrespondentCode', 'EIM_NSFInstruction', 'FloatUseInstruction', 'GovernmentFunds', 'TranHistoryOption', 'TrustDeposit', 'MemoPostProcessOptOvrd', 'LargeItemOption',  'ProdIntRateId', 'PublicFunds', 'RetentionOption', 'SecuredDeposit', 'SignificantBalChgOption' and 'HoldUseInstruction'.
