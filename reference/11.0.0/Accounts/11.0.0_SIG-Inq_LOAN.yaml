This normally would be done if the borrower is struggling with repayments.\n\nThe lender agrees to split the existing loan balance into two parts. The main part remains as the active loan, with scheduled monthly repayments and interest continuing to accumulate.\n\nThe deferred balance often becomes an interest-free loan to be paid off as a lump sum at the end of the loan term.\n\n**Note:** This aggregate is applicable to the clients using deferred balance modification in Signature."
