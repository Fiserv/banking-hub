        Details related to deffered balance of the loan account.

        A deferred balance is one possible method for a borrower to modify a loan. This normally would be done if the borrower is struggling with repayments.

        The lender agrees to split the existing loan balance into two parts. The main part remains as the active loan, with scheduled monthly repayments and interest continuing to accumulate.

        The deferred balance often becomes an interest-free loan to be paid off as a lump sum at the end of the loan term.
