      summary: Add Account.
      description: Add Account API creates a new Loan Account (LOAN).<br>For Precision, this API creates the new escrow record if the loan includes an escrow.<br>For both the loan account and the escrow record (if any), Precision has the ability to insert default values defined for the selected Loan Type (Product Type).<br>This API supports the Open Verification Method (OVM), as Precision defines, to insert the default values. <br>This means, while creating a new account with the fields sent in the Add Account request, the Loan default types defined within the Precision parameters may get overridden. The override depends on the setting of the New Account Override attribute for each field where a default value has been defined.<br>Precision uses the default values to populate the fields whose default value is defined but not included in the Add Account request.<br> <br> To download the API Specifications and Postman Collection, click <a href=\"../docs/?path=docs/resources/resources.md\" title=\"Click to open\">Resources</a>.
