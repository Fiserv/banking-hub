      description: "Add Account API creates a new Demand Deposit Account (DDA) and Saving Account (SDA).<br>If applicable, account analysis is also created for a new account.<br>Precision has the ability to insert default values defined for the selected DDA and SDA Type (Type Code).<br>This API supports the Open Verification Method (OVM), as Precision defines, to insert the default values. <br>This means, while creating a new account with the fields sent in the Add Account request, the DDA and SDA default types defined within the Precision parameters may get overridden. The override depends on the setting of the New Account Override attribute for each field where a default value has been defined.<br>Precision uses the default values to populate the fields whose default value is defined but not included in the Add Account request.<br> <br> To download the API Specifications and Postman Collection, click <a href=\"../docs/?path=docs/resources/resources.md\" title=\"Click to open\">Resources</a>."
