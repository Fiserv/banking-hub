        **Note:** If the aggregate is not sent or PartyId is not valid in Premier or happens to be a non-owner (secondary) customer on the account - the 'EmailAddr' would be updated on the first name (primary owner) corresponding to the account, as a default behavior. The aggregate should be provided to update the EmailAddr on the primary/first contact of the PartyId (customer) sent in request (already having a person/business email), else the EmailAddr shall be updated in new contact record. The PartyId sent in, must be one of the owners (that is, first or second or third name) on the account, for the email to be updated on the respective customer only and override the default behavior. Email address corresponding to a secondary customer (non-owner) is not supported by premier to receive the electronic statements and cannot be updated by this operation.

            **Note:** By default, the EmailAddr is updated on the first name (primary owner) of the account, within the primary contact or first record having person/business email. If no such contact record exists, then a new contact record is created on the party (if allowed by premier), with the updated EmailAddr. If EmailAddr is not provided or sent as blank/empty in the request, the existing EmailAddr on the contact record is retained as-is in premier. In case PartyId is sent in request and is an owner on the account (first/second/third), then the EmailAddr is updated in the party's primary contact record or first record having person/business email, else email is updated in a new contact record, created for the party (as explained above). Else, if the party is not an owner or invalid, then default behavior persists and the email sent in request is updated on first name (owner), as per behavior described above.
