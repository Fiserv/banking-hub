In case both are sent but the portfolio account is not the same as the credit line account, then ESF link the new loan account to existing portfolio account that is sent in the request (assumes precedence) and the credit line already associated to the portfolio account shall be linked to the Loan account. Therefore calling application must therefore ensure that the correct portfolio account is sent in request and that it is already linked to a credit line, as ESF does not create a new Portfolio or CreditLine in this case\n\n- For a customer who has only a porfolio account, portfolio number can be provided without credit line number. In this case, ESF use existing porfolio number to create a new credit line and link new loan account to existing portflio and newly created credit line. If the portfolio acount is already linked to a credit line, then the credit line account number should be sent in the request, instead of the portfolio account number\n\n- For a customer who does not have a porfolio and credit line , ESF will create a new portfolio account and a new credit line during loan account opening workflow\n\n\n\nIf only credit line account is provided in request, then the loan account would be linked to the existing credit line sent in request and the portfolio account that is already associated to the credit line shall be linked to the Loan (by default in Premier).\n\nOnly one credit line can be associated to a portfolio, therefore if portfolio already has a existing credit line and credit line is not provided in the request when opening loan account, ESF will attempt to create new credit line, relate it to portfolio and request will fail. \n\nHowever portfolio and a credit line can have multiple loan accounts linked to it."
