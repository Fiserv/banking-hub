            Account can have one primary, one secondary and two seasonal addresses associated to it.

            Seasonal address cannot exist as a single address record and is related to either primary or secondary address. Therefore, seasonal address shares AddressIdent and AddrUse fields with primary and secondary address.

            - If parameter is set to N, both inquiry and mailing addresses are same therefore, only primary address type and AddrUse as Inquiry is to be provided.

            - If parameter is set to Y, both inquiry and mailing addresses can be different therefore, secondary address type and AddrUse as mailing and names is to be provided.

            If new address is to be created for an account, address details including AddrType, AddrUse and AdddrFormatType is required and AddressIdent should not be provided in the request.
