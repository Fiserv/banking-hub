      summary: Add Account.
      description: Add Account API creates a new Loan Account (LOAN).<br>For Signature, while creating an account this API can add up to five secondary or seasonal address records. <br>This API supports a standardized address format for parsed addresses. While using the standardized format, the Postal address aggregate is consolidated into two address line fields that are Address line 1 and Address line 2, instead of segregating them into multiple independent fields such as House number, Street, Apartment number and Apartment number type.<br>This API can also set up user-defined fields (ClientDefinedData) when creating a new account. Signature supports 66 fields out of which 60 are user-defined fields, four are user fields and two are user codes.<br><b>Note:</b> In Signature customers having Update Account API for Small Business Administration (SBA) loan account, this API provides the "SBAData" aggregate that contains fields such as SBA Status, Sold Status, GP Number, Basis Fee Percentage, Basis Fee Percentage and Guarantee Percentage to store information. However, this information is currently not retrieved in the response of the Get Account API. <br> <br> To download the API Specifications and Postman Collection, click <a href=\"../docs/?path=docs/resources/resources.md\" title=\"Click to open\">Resources</a>.
