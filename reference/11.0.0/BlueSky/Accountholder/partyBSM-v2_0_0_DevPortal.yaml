      description: "Indicates a more specific status of the account.  Values:\n  \n  * 'Active' - An open bank account in which transactions can be made\n  * 'Bankruptcy' - Bankruptcy is a legal process through which people or other entities who cannot repay debts to creditors may seek relief from some or all of their debts. In most jurisdictions, bankruptcy is imposed by a court order, often initiated by the debtor\n  * 'ChargedOff' - A charged-off is a declaration by a creditor that an amount of debt is unlikely to be collected. Also known as Written-Off\n  * 'ClientDefined' - The status has been defined by the financial institution\n  * 'Closed' - A closed account is any account that has been deactivated or otherwise terminated, either by the customer, custodian or counterparty. At this stage, no further credits and debits can be added.\n  * 'ClosedReopenDeposit' - The account has been closed but it could be reopened with a deposit. Some banks close accounts with zero balance but allow the account to be reopened if a deposit occurs\n  * 'ClosedToAdvances' - The Lender stops full or partial advances of the loan to the borrower\n  * 'ClosedToday' -  Prevents any posting and/or maintenance to the account status on the day the closing transaction is performed\n  * 'ClosedToPosting' - The account cannot accept debit or credit transactions\n  * 'ClosedWithBalances' - The account has been closed with outstanding balances\n  * 'Collection' - The account has been referred to a collection agency to collect on the bad debt\n  * 'CoolingOff' - Indicates the account is within the grace period where the customer has rights to cancel a credit agreement –NEED VALIDATION\n  * 'Delinquent' - A delinquent account means that the account is behind on payments\n  * 'Dormant' - A dormant account is an account that has had no financial activity for a long period of time, except for the posting of interest. Financial institutions are required by state laws to transfer resources held in dormant accounts to the state's treasury after the accounts have been dormant for a certain period of time\n  * 'EarlyCollection' - The account has started the process of collection.\n  * 'Escheated' - When money lies dormant in a deposit account or appears to be abandoned, the bank or other organizations with which the money was deposited aren’t necessarily allowed to just keep that money for their own use. After a period of time, they’re required to turn it over to the state. This is called escheatment. Once it's turned over to the state for safekeeping, the owner of the money can still access it by making a proper claim for it\n  * 'Foreclosure' - Foreclosure is a legal process in which a lender attempts to recover the balance of a loan from a borrower who has stopped making payments to the lender by forcing the sale of the asset used as the collateral for the loan\n  * 'Hold' - There is a restriction on an account owner's ability to access funds in the account due to various reasons. When a bank places an account on hold, it usually does so to protect itself from potential loss, but it also may have the interest of the customer in mind\n  * 'Inactive' -A bank account that has not been used for a long period of time\n  * 'Matured' -  Refers to the date at which a certificate of deposit or CD reaches the last date of its term. The Deposit Maturity also marks the date when the CD is either redeemed for face value or has its maturity rolled over to a later date\n  * 'Managed' - The account is manually controlled by the financial institution. The account is being monitored outside from an automated inactive/dormant schedule maybe because of suspicious activity.\n  * 'New' -  New account today\n  * 'NewThisMonth' - New account this month\n  * 'NoCreditPost' - An account that does not accept credit   transactions\n  * 'NoDebitPost' - Post no debit is a situation where all debit transactions are prevented (blocked) on an account to stop money from going out of the bank account\n  * 'NonAccrual' - A nonaccrual loan is a lender's term for an unsecured loan whose payment is 90 days or more overdue. The loan is no longer generating its stated interest rate because no payment has been made by the borrower. It is, therefore, a nonperforming loan. Loans can have interest credited only when the borrower makes a payment (of a portion of the principal plus interest). The interest on a nonaccrual loan is thus recorded as earned income. Nonaccrual loans are sometimes referred to as doubtful loans, troubled loans, or sour loans\n  * 'NoRenew' - An account that does not renew at maturity or on expiration\n  * 'NoWithdrawal' - An account that does not accept withdrawal transactions\n  * 'Pending' - An account that has not been fully onboarded on the system\n  * 'Probate' - Probate is the legal process of distributing a dead person's assets. When someone dies, he or she usually leaves behind assets to distribute   and debts to pay.\n  * 'Purge' - The account has been irrevocably closed. In the system of record old and unneeded data has been removed\n  * 'Repossession' - Repossession occurs when the account has not received loan payments and the collateral is seize\n  * 'TransferredOut' - The account has been transferred or sold to another financial institution or collection agency \n  * 'Void' - An acccount was opened in error and it has been voided for processing"
