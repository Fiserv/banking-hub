  description: |-
    Auto Enrollement Service supports operations to manage enrollment or subscription of accounts to be part of Bank Administration Institute (BAI) file format used by financial institutions to transfer financial data between the core banking system and client applications.
    This service is only supported by Signature clients that have installed the BAI File Enrollment Solution (this is not a base feature in Signature). Every client application will have a BAICode that identifies them.  In current functionality the only enrollment allowed is Arch_Extract which is  used by the Architect Online Banking Client Application.
