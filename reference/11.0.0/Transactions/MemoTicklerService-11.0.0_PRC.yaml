  description: |-
    Memo tickler service supports operations to manage memo and ticklers.
        <br>
        Memo and ticklers are used to notify the officers from financial institutions regarding important messages or actions that need to take place when interacting with the customer or performing a transaction to the customer's account.
        <br>
        Memo is a continuous message that does not require any specific action to be taken on it. Tickler is a one-time or recurring message which may require some specific action to be taken.
