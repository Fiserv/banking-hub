            If Parameter Configuration "MaxRec_Count" is set up for the Organization and MaxRecLimit is not provided, ESF uses Parameter Configuration setup to determine the number of transactions to be returned in the response. If MaxRecLimit is provided in the request, then default MaxRecLimit in Parameter Configuration is overridden by the value of MaxRecLimit provided in the request.

            Consumer is advised to provide the same value in MaxRecLimit during each request in order to receive the next set of Posted transactions.  Not providing MaxRecLimit in a consistent manner may result in missed transactions or transactions returned repetitively.
