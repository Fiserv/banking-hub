      summary: GET Account Transaction History.
      description: "Get Account Transaction History API retrieves the transaction history for Demand Deposit Account (DDA), Savings Deposit Account (SDA), Certificate of Deposit Account (CDA) and Demand Deposit Loan (DDL) account.<br>For Premier, this API retrieves memo posted transactions from premier and hard posted transactions from the Premier Activity Management System (AMS2.0). All DDL account transactions are hard posted in Premier. It provides the ability to request for certain number of transaction history and provide several selection criteria to retrieve the transaction records. If requested, running balance is available for posted transactions when the original order is not altered. However, it does not return statement running balance. It also supports cursor logic ability to request for the next set of transactions. Cursor logic ability is applicable to the posted transactions that are there in Activity Management System (AMS). This ability does not apply to memo posted transactions, as a result the first request returns all the available memo-posted transaction on the account. This API is available to clients who have purchased Activity Management System (AMS). <br> <br> To download the API Specifications and Postman Collection, click <a href=\"../docs/?path=docs/resources/resources.md\" title=\"Click to open\">Resources</a>."
