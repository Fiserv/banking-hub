In this API, the information on closed accounts can be excluded or included. <br> Pagination does not support returning Portfolio or Line accounts in the response. Also, when the accounts with DDL account type are associated with a party, the PartyAcctRelInq service may provide more records (up-to twice) than the number requested, while paginating through DDA and DDL accounts. That is, the record count returned in the response will not match the record count in the request. </p> </summary> </details> <br> <br> To download the API Specifications and Postman Collection, click <a href=\"../docs/?path=docs/resources/resources.md\" title=\"Click to open\">Resources</a>.

            **Note:** Postal code provides information about the ZIP code, if address is a United States address. It also provides postal code information, if address is a non-US address.  The format of ZIP code consists of five digits for the ZIP code, a hyphen, and four additional digits that determine a more specific location within a given ZIP code. The four additional digits are optional.  Examples: 32714-1234 or 32714-0000 or 32714.







            Postal codes for nn-US addresses are simply a string of characters.
