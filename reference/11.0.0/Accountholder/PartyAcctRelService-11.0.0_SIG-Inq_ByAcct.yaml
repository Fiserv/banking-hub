      summary: Get Party Account Relationship
      description: "Get Party Account Relationship API provides the list of all parties (Persons or Organizations) related to the account. <br>This API provides information about postal addresses associated with the party. Signature supports one primary address and one secondary or seasonal address (optional) of a party. Primary or Secondary addresses may have either parsed or label address format. <br>For Parsed addresses, when using the standardized format, instead of segregated into multiple independent fields such as House number, Street, Apartment number and Apartment number type, the Postal Address aggregate uses two address lines field that are Address line 1 and Address line 2. Signature also supports mixed address format types. <br> <br> To download the API Specifications and Postman Collection, click <a href=\"../docs/?path=docs/resources/resources.md\" title=\"Click to open\">Resources</a>."
