      description: "Add Address API creates a secondary or seasonal address records for a party or an account using a parsed address format.<br>For Signature, only one secondary or seasonal address is associated with party, card and Safe Deposit Box (SDB) accounts. The address use field identifies the various types of secondary and seasonal addresses for loan and deposit account types. Only one address can be added per service request. <br>This API supports a standardized address format for parsed addresses. While using the standardized format, the Postal address aggregate is consolidated into two address line fields that are Address line 1 and Address line 2, instead of segregating into multiple independent fields such as House number, Street, Apartment number and Apartment number type. <br> <br> To download the API Specifications and Postman Collection, click <a href=\"../docs/?path=docs/resources/resources.md\" title=\"Click to open\">Resources</a>."
