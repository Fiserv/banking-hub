      summary: Get Party Account Relationship
      description: Get Party Account Relationship By Tax ID number API provides the list of all parties having Persons or Organizations related to the account. <br> For Premier, this API provides the information about relationship type between the Party with the specified Tax Identifier and each Account. Up to five relationship types in the request (plus two additional Portfolio relationship types) are supported. Pagination functionality is used with RecCtrl aggregates. <br> <details> <summary>Click here to read more </summary> <p> This API filters the accounts by relationship types, such as the accounts linked to the party with those relationships will be returned in the response. <br> Pagination does not support returning Portfolio or Line accounts in the response. Also, when the accounts with DDL account type are associated with a party, the PartyAcctRelInq service may provide more records (up-to twice) than the number requested, while paginating through DDA and DDL accounts. That is, the record count returned in the response will not match the record count requested in the request. </p> </details>
