      description: "Update Party API modifies the information related to the party record. <br>This API also updates the postal addresses with the party. In Signature, a Party (Business or Person) must have one Primary address and can have one Secondary or Seasonal address as an optional address. Primary address can only be maintained in Parsed address format type. A Secondary/Seasonal address may have either parsed or label address format. This API uses the standardized address format for parsed addresses. Signature supports one primary address and one secondary or seasonal address (optional) of a party.
