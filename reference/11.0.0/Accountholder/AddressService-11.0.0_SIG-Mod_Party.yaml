      description: "Update Address API modifies the existing primary and secondary/seasonal address records associated with the account using a parsed address format.<br>In Signature, a party must have one primary address and one secondary or seasonal address (optional).<br>This API only supports modification of the primary address of the party using the parsed address format and modification of the secondary/seasonal address record using parsed or label address format.<br>This API supports a standardized address format for the parsed addresses. While using the standardized format, the Postal address aggregate is consolidated into two address line fields that are Address line 1 and Address line 2, instead of segregating into multiple independent fields such as House number, Street, Apartment number and Apartment number type. <br> <br> To download the API Specifications and Postman Collection, click <a href=\"../docs/?path=docs/resources/resources.md\" title=\"Click to open\">Resources</a>."
