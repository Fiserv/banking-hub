      summary: Add Safe Deposit Box
      description: "Add Safe Deposit Box API creates a new Safe Deposit Box (SDB) account and relates it to one or more parties. Party can be person party (retail) or organization party (business). <br>This API adds a secondary or seasonal address to the account during the account set-up. Only one secondary or seasonal address can be added for a safe deposit box account. <br>This API uses the standardized address format for parsed addresses. When using the standardized format, instead of segregated into multiple independent fields such as House number, Street, Apartment number and Apartment number type, the Postal Address aggregate uses two address line fields that are Address line 1 and Address line 2. <br> <br> To download the API Specifications and Postman Collection, click <a href=\"../docs/?path=docs/resources/resources.md\" title=\"Click to open\">Resources</a>."
