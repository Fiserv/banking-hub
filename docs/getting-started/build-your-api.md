3. Production – Launch your app
<What credentials are required for each environment>


### Sandbox
How to configure Sandbox environment (*Article on this topic*)


### Development Environment
The development environment allows you to simulate a production environment with mock users and transactions to test the application. Using the simulated environment, you can also view the HTTP requests and responses to gain an understanding of the behavior and capabilities of the APIs.

Prerequisites:
* Test certificate <link>
* Authentication Key

To authenticate your application, you are required to certify the application against an environment that mirrors production in a bank or credit union. To get a certification for test environment, you are required to register for an API key. After successful registration, you will be assigned an endpoint that you can use for testing and validating your application.


### Production Environment
Upon successful application validation, your application will be ready for production. Fiserv will issue you the endpoints available for your application.

Prerequisites:
* Production certificate <link>
*	Authentication Key
*	Organization ID
*	Vendor ID
