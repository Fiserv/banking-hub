# Before You Start
<!-- theme: info -->
> #### Note for Developers 
>
> The current user journey enables developers to access a range of Standard Bank Platform APIs on Banking Hub. We continue to refine the API content on Banking Hub with the goal of showing clearly how our Banking Hub APIs facilitate integration to each of our banking solutions.  <br> <br> We are working on developing a registered user journey. Once registration is enabled on Developer Studio, you can sign up to obtain credentials along with the instructions to integrate Banking Hub APIs with our banking platforms. Additionally, you get access to our Sandbox environment to test APIs or may choose to test <a href="?path=docs/getting-started/make-your-first-api-call.md#using-third-party-api-testing-tools" > Using Third-party API Testing Tools</a>.


Register to the Fiserv Developer Studio to test the APIs in test and live environments. However, registration is not required to learn about our API integration process and test the APIs in API Explorer.

## Register to Fiserv Developer Studio
To validate and deploy Fiserv banking APIs into production, create an account with Fiserv Developer Studio to obtain credentials for sandbox testing and live environments.

    * Product name :_Name of the product, for example, Banking Hub._
    
    * Org ID :_Organization ID is required to send in all API requests as a header parameter._
    
    * API key name :_Name of API key_
    * API key type :_Type of API key, for example, Trial._
    * API key :_Alphanumeric value of API key. API key is used as username while generation access token._
    * API secret :_Alphanumeric value of API secret. API secret is used as password while generation access token._
    * Host URL :_Host URL path to send API requests._

## Generating Access Token

An access token is used to authenticate your API build and allows you to use the Fiserv APIs securely. API Key and API Secret values obtained from the Workspace are required to generate an access token. 

Use below API to generate an access token using Postman.

### URL
