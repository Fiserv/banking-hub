# Content Management

Fiserv enterprise content management (ECM) solutions enable financial institutions to manage and preserve reports, documents and electronic images related to financial processes. These solutions make it possible to electronify virtually any document related to banking functions from ID cards to legacy reports and house them in a single digital repository. Users can scan, import, store, modify and distribute these documents electronically. 


Users can also easily retrieve documents from the central repository for research purposes and create workflows for document-based processes to enhance efficiency. Other features ensure that documents are stored securely and in compliance with applicable regulations. These solutions also support implementation of retention policies for stored documents and executive reporting.
