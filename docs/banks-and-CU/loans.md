# Loans

Fiserv core account processing solutions provide the functionality to support the full range of loan accounts offered by financial institutions. This includes auto loans, student loans, other consumer loans, mortgages, home equity lines of credit, construction loans, Small Business Administration loans, agricultural loans, and for corporate entities, more complex loans such as commercial real estate (CRE) and commercial and industrial (C&I) loans. 


Our solutions enable users to set up and maintain loan accounts in a manner that complies with applicable regulations. They make it possible to track transactions (payments and draws), calculate balances and interest, assign or modify interest rates, assess or modify late fees, generate necessary notices and statements, produce tax reporting documents, and record or modify information about parties related to a loan account such as names, addresses, tax IDs, contact information and the nature of the partyâ€™s relationship to the loan. In addition, they support the creation and tracking of collateral related to a loan and calculate loan-to-value ratios.
