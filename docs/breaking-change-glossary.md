# Breaking Change 

Breaking changes are modifications in a service operation that are not backward-compatible and can potentially disrupt existing functionality for the users or dependent systems. Identifying and handling these changes is essential to ensure a smooth transition and maintain system stability. 
<br>The following are the breaking change types that developer portal supports:
