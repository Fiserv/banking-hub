# Getting help using Client360
<!-- theme: info -->

Your companyâ€™s Primary Administrator in AppMarket or person who purchased the Developer Studio Connection: Banking Hub plan received an email with credentials and sign on details to Client360. Client360 is our self-service platform which includes intuitive navigation and artificial intelligence (AI). Solution-specific service menus provide a clearer path to creating an inquiry to reduce the number of times you must clarify your request. As a result, you will open a case for your question or issue and have it routed to the appropriate team for quick resolution and response:
    * Please note that there is recorded training as well as live training that you can sign up for by clicking this link.
    * Your contact Admin will own the address book for your company and be responsible for adding other team members.
    * Your team should ensure your Admin has provided access to Client360 for opening cases for your questions or issues.
    * If you are still having issues getting access to Client360 email us at AppMarketSupport@fiserv.com
