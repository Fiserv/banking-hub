# Getting Started

Welcome to the Fiserv Banking Developer Portal. This quick guide will help you to get  started with our APIs and allow you to begin integrating our services into your applications.

Following topics are covered in this guide:
* Registration
* Authentication
* Sandbox
* Certification
* Resources

## Registration

To validate and deploy Fiserv banking APIs into production, you are required to create an account on the Fiserv Developer Portal. This registration helps to create a development environment to get credentials for sandbox testing and live environments. However, registration is not required to learn about our API integration process and test the APIs.

### Setting up an Account

To set up an account on the Fiserv Developer Portal, follow the steps below:
1.	Go to the Fiserv Developer Portal registration page
2.	Follow the instructions on the screen to set up your account according to your integration requirements
3.	Sign into your Fiserv Developer Portal account after it is activated.

## Authentication

Once the account setup process is complete, you need to authenticate your API build. Authentication is required for the secure testing or integration of your API. 

### Authentication Keys

To authenticate your application, you will need test and live API authentication keys, which are obtained in the Account Setup process. Authentication keys may expire after a certain period. You may reuse the authentication keys until they expire. Once a key expires, you will need to get a new key.

### Steps for Authentication 

Follow these steps to authenticate your API build:
1.	Obtain the API authentication keys in the Account Setup process through a certified connection.
2.	Consent to using the API endpoints.
3.	Authenticate your user account with the acquired keys and retrieve the authorization code.
4.	Use the provided authorization code to access the API and Sandbox resources

## Sandbox

The Sandbox allows you to simulate a production environment with mock users and transactions to test the application. Using the simulated environment, you can also view the HTTP requests and responses to gain an understanding of the behavior and capabilities of the APIs. 

Follow these steps to test your application in the Sandbox environment:
1.	Choose the Application: Access the Sandbox environment and choose an application to use for testing.
2.	Create a mock user database: Create user accountsâ€”a personal account that simulates a customer and a business account that simulates a merchant.
3.	Create mock transactions: In the Sandbox environment, add transactions between the customer and the merchant.
4.	Test the environment: With the mock data setup, you can now make API calls and test your application.
Note: Use the Sandbox authorization code while making the API calls.

## Certification

To authenticate your application, you are required to certify the application against an environment that mirrors production in a bank or credit union.

### Test Certification 

To get a certification for test environment, you are required to register for an API key. After successful registration, you will be assigned an endpoint that you can use for testing and validating your application.

### Production Certification

Upon successful application validation, your application will be ready for production.  Fiserv will issue you the endpoints available for your application.
