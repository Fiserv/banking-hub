* Activate your account! This is really important to complete so that you can payout to your account

* Add your bank account and double-check that it’s correct. We’ll sometimes ask for more information to help us verify your bank account
* After you make your first charge, just note that the first payout for every new Open Banking account is made 7 business days after the first successful payment is received - more about this here!
