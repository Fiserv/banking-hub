<span style="font-size: 22px; ">Get Memo Tickler-Acct, Get Memo Tickler-Party</span> *API Explorer > Transactions > Memo Tickler Service*


- Previously, the response message failed to retrieve multiple memo ticklers associated with an account or party record. We resolved this issue so that users can retrieve all the memo ticklers successfully

- We resolved the issue in which the system does not generate "HTTP 200-OK 1120- No Records Match Selection Criteria" response, if a user sent the request with the MemoTicklerIdent as blank or with an invalid value

- We resolved the issue in which the system does not generate "HTTP 200-OK 1120-No Records Match Selection Criteria" response, when the memo ticker usage was "Memo" or "MemoRequired" in the request


<span style="font-size: 22px; ">Add Stop Check</span> *API Explorer > Transactions > Stop Check Service*


- The system generated an error exception in the response even when the configuration of fee amount code, fee option and fee waive reason code is correct for the associated organization and client application. To resolve this issue, we have corrected the code


<span style="font-size: 22px; ">Get Party</span> *API Explorer > Accountholder > Party Service*
