### Fixed
  
| API Name | Description | 
| -------- | ----------- |
| Get Safe Deposit Box, Get Party, Get Party Account Relationship | Previously, the API returned enum description fields in the response message when the `ClientAppName` field was not provided in the request header. This impacted the performance as multiple calls were used to retrieve the enum description fields. Now, the user has choice to enable or disable the enum description calls with the help of configuration for the specific organization (`OrganizationId`) and client (`ClientAppName`). | <!-- ESFABUS-9035, ESFACYC-11408, ESFACYC-11415 -->
