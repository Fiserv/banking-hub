# Accounts and Transactions

Accounts and Transactions is an API domain consisting of APIs that are specific to Fiserv core account processing platforms and enable users to create, maintain and retrieve information about accounts within a financial institution, as well as transactions and balances related to those accounts. 

Supporting the creation and maintenance of a full range of deposit, savings and loan accounts,  these APIs can be used to access account lists, transaction data and balance information.
