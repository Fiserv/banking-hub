# Cards

Cards is an API domain consisting of APIs that support the creation, maintenance and retrieval of card records. Specific to card records that reside on a Fiserv core account processing platform, these APIs enable users to add, retrieve, modify or delete a debit card associated with an account, and can also be used to retrieve or modify a list of the cards associated with a particular accountholder or account. They also make it possible to retrieve the product specifications that define the relationship between a card and an account. 

**Who is it for:** Developers creating or integrating apps that access information about card accounts and transactions maintained on a Fiserv core account processing platform

**How is it used:** These APIs can be used to create or integrate applications that include the ability to monitor card accounts or facilitate cards-based money movement.


Begin integration with these APIs by going to [API Explorer](../api/?type=post&path=/cards)
