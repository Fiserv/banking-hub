# Payments

Payments is an API domain consisting of payment transaction-related APIs that support connections to payment networks, central cash management and check processing. Specific to Fiserv account processing platforms, these APIs enable credits, debits and transfers to be added or reversed, and they facilitate processing through our Fiserv enterprise payments hub and real-time network.

**Who is it for:** Developers creating or integrating apps that need to access payments-related APIs and integrate their applications to Fiserv core account processing platforms

**How is it used:** These APIs can be used to create or integrate applications that deliver frictionless money movement through novel channels.
