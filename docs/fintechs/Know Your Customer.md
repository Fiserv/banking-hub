# Consumer Identity Authentication 

Consumer Identity Authentication (KYC) is the process of verifying a customer's identity and ensures that a customer is who they say they are. Consumer identity authentication is a standard due diligence process used by financial institutions and other financial services companies to assess and monitor customer risk. Customer identity authentication also helps determine if the customer can meet the business requirements to use their services and stay compliant with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.

**How is it used:** Employ these APIs to create or integrate Know You Customer applications with public record databases to authenticate a customer's personal information such as identity, address and phone.
