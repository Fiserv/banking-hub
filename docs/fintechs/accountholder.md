# Accountholder

Account Holders is an API domain that consists of APIs essential to maintaining financial institution accountholder data, including the relationships between customers and accounts.
 
Specific to Fiserv core account processing platforms, these APIs make it possible to add or delete parties from accounts and specify their relationships to those accounts such as owner, signer, beneficiary, trustee, custodian and so forth. Calls made using these APIs enable the creation, updating or retrieval of accountholder information.

**How is it used:** Employ these APIs to create or integrate applications that require the ability to define relationships between individual parties and accounts and determine which accounts an individual party can access.
