# Accounts

Accounts is an API domain consisting of APIs that are specific to Fiserv core account processing platforms and enable users to create, maintain and retrieve information about accounts within a financial institution.

Supporting the creation and maintenance of a full range of deposit, savings and loan accounts, these APIs can be used to add accounts, retrieve account details, update accounts, add collateral relationships to accounts and manage holds on accounts. 

**Who is it for:** Any developer creating or integrating apps that need to interact with account data maintained on Fiserv core account processing platforms

**How is it used:** Employ these APIs to develop apps that offer unique experiences or novel channels through which users can originate, access or modify deposit, savings or loan accounts

**Potential uses:** Apps that tailor the digital account opening or loan origination experience to meet the distinct needs of specific markets such as generational segments, sole proprietors, small businesses and particular communities or industries
